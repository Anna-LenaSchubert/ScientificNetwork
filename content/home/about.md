The aim of the  Scientific Network is to develop reliable and valid measurements of person parameters in elementary cognitive processes. Although individual differences in elementary cognitive processes are of great theoretical importance in many research areas, well-known measurement problems limit the integratability and interpretability of previous findings and may lead to underestimation over overestimation of correlations with other variables.The Scientific Network will address these measurement problems from the perspectives of cognitive and biological psychology and psychometrics. The overall aim is to discuss interdisciplinary methods for overcoming the identified measurement problems and to develop innovative approaches for improving the measurement of interindividual differences in elementary cognitive processes. The measurement of cognitive processes will be considered from different disciplinary perspectives brought together in the network.
