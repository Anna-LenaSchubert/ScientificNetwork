  mathematical models of cognition to overcome measurement problems with the
  goal to link theoretically guided measures of cognitive processes with
  individual differences in cognitive abilities. Her work integrates
  psychometric approaches with cognitive psychology, electrophysiology, and
  individual differences research.
